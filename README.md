# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for Semiconductor Device Simulation

This repository contains a C++17 implementation of a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** for solving the **Drift–Diffusion semiconductor equations**. The goal is to create a fast, differentiable, ML-based alternative to classical TCAD-style solvers.

## 🚀 Features
- Pure C++ neural network implementation (no TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Solves:
- Poisson equation
- Electron continuity equation
- Hole continuity equation
- Physics-informed loss (PDE residuals + boundary conditions)
- Extensible architecture
- Python scripts for visualization
